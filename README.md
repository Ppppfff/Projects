# Department Store Website

A simple yet functional web application that allows users to sign in/sign up, browse items by department, add them to a cart, and filter by price. An admin panel is also included for managing departments and items.

> üíº *This was my first full-stack project using React and .NET (also my first time using react and C#), completed during my internship at [SEG International](https://azseg.com/). It helped me gain hands-on experience with modern web development, authentication, state management, REST APIs, and database design.*

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine.

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/department-store.git 
```

### 2. **Run the Frontend**

Navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd App1-Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 3. **Set Up and Run the Backend**

The backend is built using **.NET**, so you'll need the .NET SDK installed.

#### a. Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd App1-Backend
```

#### b. Restore dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

#### c. Create and Migrate the Database

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you're in the `App1-Backend\Infrastructure` folder before proceeding.

Using the **Package Manager Console** in **Visual Studio 2022**, run:

```powershell
Add-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database
```

> Replace `InitialCreate` with a meaningful migration name if needed.

#### d. Start the backend server

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Go back to the `App1-Backend\App1CleanArchitecture` folder before proceeding.

```bash
dotnet run
```

The backend will start running at `http://localhost:5036` or similar (depends on your configuration).

---

### ‚úÖ You're all set!

Now you can access the app at `http://localhost:3000` and interact with the backend APIs running on `http://localhost:5036`.
